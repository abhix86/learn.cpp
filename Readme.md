This repository contains all my C++ learning and practice work.

Files inside `practices_byDays/` are organized by the day I wrote them. Each `.cpp` file represents a day's work and learning.

## üî® Mini Projects
Projects like `calculator`, `mini-games`, etc., will be placed in separate folders like `project_1`, `project_2`, and so on.

## ‚úÖ Goal
