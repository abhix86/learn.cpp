# learn.cpp

This repository contains all my C++ learning and practice work.

## 🗂️ Structure


## 📅 Daily Practice
Files inside `practices_byDays/` are organized by the day I wrote them. Each `.cpp` file represents a day's work and learning.

## 🔨 Mini Projects
Projects like `calculator`, `mini-games`, etc., will be placed in separate folders like `project_1`, `project_2`, and so on.

## ✅ Goal
- Strengthen my C++ fundamentals
- Prepare for DSA & problem-solving
- Build small, cool projects along the way 🚀
